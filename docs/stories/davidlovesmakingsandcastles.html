One day he decided to go to the beach and build a sand castle. He piled sand and packed it down. But David built his sandcastle too close to the water and it got destroyed by a wave. David was upset. <br/><br/>He picked himself up and decided to build another one. This time he would make it bigger and better, further from the water, closer to his beach umbrella. He piled more sand and packed it down. But then his cousins, Lily and Bob, were pretending to be T-Rex dinosaurs, stomping around and they accidentally destroyed the sand castle. David was super upset.<br/><br/>David took a deep breath and decided to build another one. This time he would make an even bigger, super duper huge sand castle. He piled even more sand and packed it down. As he was finishing the last tower, some people came by and they were getting too close to his super duper huge sand castle. They had tools and other things with them that made David think his sand castle was in danger. Since David knew kung fu, he started fighting them. <br/><br/>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you destroy my sand castle!&#8221; David said.<br/><br/>The people explained &#8220;we did not come here to destroy your sand castle. We came here to measure it! It might just be the biggest one we have ever seen!&#8221; <br/><br/>David was surprised. &#8220;Really?&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Yes, and we are going to make you and your sand castle famous by adding it to the Guinness Book of World Records!&#8221;<br/><br/>David was even more surprised. &#8220;Reeaaally?&#8221;<br/><br/>Then the people took measurements with their rulers and clipboards, and took tons of pictures. David&#8217;s sand castle became famous all around the world. <br/><br/><br/>The End.<br/><br/><br/><br/></span><span class="textstyle7">The moral of the story is: </span>    <span class="textstyle6"><br/>Don&#8217;t forget to practice your posing in case someone wants to make you famous.</span>
